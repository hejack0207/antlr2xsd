# antlr2xsd
Converts ANTLR g4 grammar to XSD for XML

See example in test/test.py for Modelica.

[g4](test/g4/Modelica.g4)
[xsd](test/output/Pymoca.xsd)

Note that to make ANTLR preview work well with pycharm, LexAdaptor is disabled. The consequence is that you must just pass the parse rules of your g4 file for now.
